        <h2>Why Cosmic Data Stories?</h2>
        <p>In Cosmic Data Stories, students collect and analyze their own astronomy data. Student's measurements are stored anonymously in the CosmicDS database. Creating an account will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Associate student data with their class cohort</li>
          <li>Allow students to view their results within the context of their class's dataset and the full participant dataset.</li>
          <li>Keep track of students' place within the data story if they aren't able to finish the story within one class period.</li>
        </ul>
